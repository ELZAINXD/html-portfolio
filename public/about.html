<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am an aspiring web developer looking to learn more about the web and what it has to offer!</p>

<p>Currently I am still learning web development but I have a background in object oriented programming, logic design, signal processing, control systems, and computer architecture.</p>

<p>One day, I will become a software engineer or a full-stack developer in the tech industry. I will get there!</p>
